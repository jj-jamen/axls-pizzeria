# Axl's Pizzeria (Front End)

**Axl's Pizzeria** is a project I created to improve my skills in `HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.` It’s a static online storefront designed to showcase how to build a simple yet professional website. Through this project, I focused on creating a clean, modular design while learning how to dynamically display products using JSON and implement features like time-zone-based store availability.

## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Product Display**:  
  Products are fetched from a JSON template, making it easy to add, edit, or remove products without modifying the core code.
- **Time Zone-based Availability**:  
  Displays store availability based on the visitor's local time zone, enhancing the user experience.
- **Lightweight and Modular**:  
  The project is designed to be simple, fast, and easily customizable.

## 🚀 Unique Aspects

- **No Node.js Needed**:  
  The project runs as a static webpage—no need for Node.js or server-side setup.
- **Live Demo**:  
  Explore the static webpage here: [Axl's Pizzeria](https://jj-jamen.github.io/axls-pizzeria/).
